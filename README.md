Project Concept — Quick-Meet Companion App 

Problem 

Many people want to do small enjoyable activities (coffee, short walk, quick meal) 

They hesitate because they don’t want to go alone 

Existing social platforms focus on large events or friendships, not spontaneous micro-plans    

Loneliness isn’t always chronic — sometimes it’s momentary hesitation 

 

Target Users 

Individuals with social anxiety who prefer low-pressure meetups 

Solution 

An app that enables instant activity companionship: 

Core Features 

Smart matching with people nearby who want the same activity now, (other attributes: gender, location, personality trait (MBTI), age) 

Ability to host quick meetups (e.g., “Coffee in 15 min?”) 

Safety layer: 

verified profiles 

location check-ins 

safety push notification 

 

Unique Value Proposition 

Focus on micro-socializing instead of friendships or dating 

Matches based on activity + time 

Built-in safety monitoring increases trust for meeting strangers 

 

How It Works 

User selects activity + time window 

AI suggests nearby matches with same intent 

Users accept match → temporary chat opens 

App monitors check-in/out for safety 

When sign up, the user has to deposit 5 dollars, to make sure that people do not ghost ditch the plans 

 

Impact 

Reduces everyday loneliness 

Encourages people to go out more 

Builds real-world social confidence 

Helps newcomers integrate into communities
